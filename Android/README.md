Realm Pop is a simple game app designed to show off the collaborative features of the [Realm Mobile Platform](https://realm.io/news/introducing-realm-mobile-platform/).

Any number of users may join and play in any given moment.

2. Run a local instance of the Realm Mobile Platform.
4. Open the Project level `build.gradle` file with Android Studio, build the app, and deploy it to an Android device.
5. When the app starts you will be automatically be logged in as demo@realm.io and be able to start playing. The Realm Object server address you enter can be local or it can be an instance running on any of our other supported Linux platforms which may also be downloaded from [Realm](https://realm.io). In either case you should ensure your firewall allows access to ports 9080 and 27800 as these are needed by the application in order to communicate wth the Realm Object Server.
